# Products-Clients-Orders-Distribution-Management-Platform
The platform was developed for a theoretical pharmacy, to give them support for COVID-19 vaccines distribution.

This application allows collaborators to manage their orders, clients, and stocks of their products. Developed in Java, following the best practices and patterns of
software development. TDD approach was used during this development. In this project, I used data structures (e.g Graphs and Trees) to calculate the best route possible for the courier to deliver a product to a client with intermediate points. JDBC API was used to connect with an Oracle database to persist all the data. To deliver the highest quality, I used SonarQube and Jenkins to measure the quality of the code and the tests. All the technical / analysis documentation such as domain model, classes, sequences diagrams and relational model were made to ensure that some patterns of software development were correctly applied.
